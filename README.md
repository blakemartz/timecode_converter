# timecode_converter
simple timecode conversion script to convert from 23.98 to 29.97df 

PLEASE NOTE:
This script was intended to provide accurate timecode conversion to represent the frame for frame timecodes in 23.98 and 29.97Df for a project in Adobe Premiere. HOWEVER, it is currently not accurate. This will get you within 20 frames, but it does not match the outpiut of the conversion as done by Adobe Premiere.
